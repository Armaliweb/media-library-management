# media-library-management
Java-based media library developed with UML and test-driven development.
*Project Idea

The purpose of this project is to design, implement, test, and document a comprehensive media library management tool using UML diagram and Java.

*How to run

We used the Intellij IDE with Java JDK 21 installed. 
Unzip the file, import "Section_3_Group_10_Project" into the IDE, and run the program.

*Key Features

LibraryDB is a class where we stored information about media, comments, playlists.. this made the code more structured, lists made serialisation easier to execute. 
User menu is used only when the login and sign up are successful.  

*Java Documentation

Comments were added to organise the code and make it clearer however, we sometimes omitted comments because the code and functions were already clear enough. 

Team Collaboration:

Like mentioned in the report, we wanted prevent overwhelming any single team member with an excessive number of classes, we decided  to collaborate closely. Initial inputs were individual, with each team member having their version of the code. In the end, we just started coding together and fixing each other's errors along the way.
